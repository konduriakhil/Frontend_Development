## Prompt to Create Notes 
---
Hi ChatGPT, I have some raw content including some code examples. Please convert it into well-organized notes with clear headings, bullet points, and simplified explanations. Make it easy to revise and suitable for interview or study purposes.
IMPORTANT: Don't skip or ignore the code â€” include all code snippets in the final notes as well
