# React JS (Prompt to Create Notes )
## live video
---
Hi, I’m studying from a video and will be sharing both code snippets and screenshots (images) in random order.

🗂️ All images are already saved in the ./images/ folder.

🔄 Your tasks right now:

Extract and store all content or snippets from the images I reference.

Track everything I send (code blocks, image content, etc.)

Use the exact filename (e.g., img1.png, img2.png) to refer to images.

📌 There are two types of images:

Images with only content or code snippets
  – Extract the text/code and store for reference.
  – Do not include these images in final notes unless I ask.

Images showing Chrome-rendered output (i.e. UI screenshots)
  – These may also include relevant snippets or notes above/below the output.
  – For these:
   ✅ Include the rendered image in the final notes
   ✅ Also extract and include any code/content present in the same image
   ✅ Embed image using Markdown syntax:

markdown
Copy
Edit
![UI Output](./images/img2.png)
🛑 Do not generate any notes yet.
Wait until I say: “make final notes”

📝 When I say “make final notes”:

Combine all shared inputs

Include:

✅ All code snippets exactly as I provided them

✅ All relevant content from image-based snippets

✅ Only the Chrome-rendered output images (with any accompanying snippet)

Format with:

Headings

Bullet points

Clear, beginner/interview-friendly explanations

## Folder reference

Hi, I’m studying from a video and will be sharing a **folder reference** with you.

That folder contains:

* `*.md` files (markdown files with code snippets and content)
* An `images/` folder that contains screenshots

---

### 🔄 Your tasks:

1. **Scan and track everything** from the provided folder:

   * Extract content/code from all referenced `.md` files
   * Extract and categorize images from the `./images/` subfolder

2. **Use the exact filenames** (e.g., `img1.png`, `img2.png`) when referring to images from the `images/` folder.

---

### 📌 There are two types of images in the `images/` folder:

#### 1. **Code or Content Only**

* Extract any code or text.
* **Do not include these images** in the final notes unless I request them.

#### 2. **Chrome-rendered output (UI screenshots)**

* These may also include relevant code/content above or below the UI.
* For such images:

  * ✅ Include the image using this syntax:

    ```markdown
    ![UI Output](./images/img2.png)
    ```
  * ✅ Also extract and include any visible code/text present in the image.

### 🛑 Do not generate notes yet.

Wait for me to say: **“make final notes”**

### 📝 When I say **“make final notes”**, do the following:

1. Combine and organize all collected inputs from:

   * `.md` files
   * Extracted image content
   * Code snippets I share directly

2. Include in the final notes:

   * ✅ Exact code snippets
   * ✅ All relevant extracted content from `.md` files and images
   * ✅ Only **Chrome-rendered output** images (with accompanying code, if any)

3. Format the output with:

   * Clear **headings**
   * **Bullet points**
   * Beginner/interview-friendly **explanations**
