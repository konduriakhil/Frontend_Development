**Prompt to ChatGPT:**

Hi, I have some raw content from a file, which includes both text and code examples. I also have some images like `![alt text](images/img1.png)` embedded in the content.

Please do the following:

1. **Convert the content into well-organized notes** with:

   * Clear headings and subheadings
   * Bullet points for key concepts
   * Simplified explanations suitable for interviews or revision

2. **Do not skip or ignore any code examples** — include **all code snippets** in the final notes with proper formatting and context.

3. **Read and extract content from images** (like `img1.png`) **if necessary**, and **integrate that content** properly into the notes in relevant sections.

Let me know if you need the actual file or image uploaded.

🧠 Prompt for Copilot or AI Assistant
Hi, I’m studying from a video and will be sharing multiple items — either images or code snippets — in random order.

✅ Each message may include:

A code snippet

An image containing either:

Text content or code (reference only)

A Chrome-rendered output screenshot (to include in final notes)

🔄 Your tasks right now:

Store and remember everything I send (images and code).

Images are already saved in the ./images folder.

From image types:

If the image contains code or content, extract and store it for reference only — do not include in final notes unless I ask.

If the image is a Chrome-rendered output, mark it to be included in the final notes, using:

markdown
Copy
Edit
![Alt text](./images/image-name.png)
🛑 Do not generate notes yet. Wait until I say: “make final notes.”

📦 Once I say “make final notes”:

Combine all content and code shared earlier

Include all code snippets exactly as I sent them

Embed only the Chrome-rendered images in the markdown notes using proper ./images references

Organize everything with:

Headings

Bullet points

Simple explanations for easy revision/interview prep

Perfect. Here’s the **final, fully clarified Copilot-style instruction** — this version includes the point that **Chrome-rendered images may also contain some snippet or content**, and that should be **included** in the final notes **along with the image**.

Hi, I’m studying from a video and will be sharing both code snippets and screenshots (images) in random order.

🗂️ All images are already saved in the ./images/ folder.

Track everything I send (code blocks, image content, etc.)

Use the exact filename (e.g., img1.png, img2.png) to refer to images.

📌 There are two types of images:

Images with only content or code snippets
  – Extract the text/code and store for reference.
  – Do not include these images in final notes unless I ask.

Images showing Chrome-rendered output (i.e. UI screenshots)
  – These may also include relevant snippets or notes above/below the output.

   ✅ Include the rendered image in the final notes
   ✅ Also extract and include any code/content present in the same image
   ✅ Embed image using Markdown syntax:

markdown
Copy

![UI Output](./images/img2.png)
🛑 Do not generate any notes yet.
Wait until I say: “make final notes”

📝 When I say “make final notes”:

Combine all shared inputs
