**AJAX** stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**. It‚Äôs a technique used in JavaScript to send and receive data from a server **without reloading the entire web page**. This allows for creating **faster and more dynamic web applications**.

---

### üîß What does AJAX do?

AJAX allows you to:

* Fetch data from a server (e.g., user details, product info)
* Send data to a server (e.g., form submissions)
* Update parts of a web page dynamically, **without a full page reload**

---

### üß† How it works (conceptually)

AJAX typically involves:

1. **Creating a request** (to a URL)
2. **Sending the request** in the background
3. **Receiving the response**
4. **Updating the DOM** with the new data

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Example using `fetch` (modern AJAX):

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
    // Update the page with the data
  })
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits

* Smooth user experience
* Reduces server load
* Faster interactions

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:

* Despite the name, AJAX is not limited to XML. JSON is more commonly used today.
* You can also use libraries like **jQuery** or frameworks like **Axios** for AJAX calls.

# Difference between get and post
Great ‚Äî you're asking about the **difference between `GET` and `POST`** in HTTP requests (used in AJAX and elsewhere). Here's a clear comparison:

---

## üîÅ `GET` vs `POST` ‚Äî Key Differences

| Feature              | `GET`                              | `POST`                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Retrieve data from the server      | Send data to the server (e.g., form data) |
| **Data Location**    | Sent in the **URL** (query string) | Sent in the **request body**              |
| **Visible to user?** | ‚úÖ Yes (URL bar)                    | ‚ùå No (not visible in URL)                 |
| **Use case**         | Read-only operations               | Create or update operations               |
| **Cacheable**        | ‚úÖ Yes (usually cached by browsers) | ‚ùå No (not cached)                         |
| **Size Limit**       | Limited (URL length limit)         | Larger payloads allowed                   |
| **Idempotent?**      | ‚úÖ Yes (same result every time)     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not necessarily                        |

## üì• Example: `GET` Request

```js
xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/user?id=123');
xhr.send();
```

* Appends data in the URL
* Best for fetching data (like reading a blog post)

---

## üì§ Example: `POST` Request

```js
xhr.open('POST', 'https://api.example.com/user');
xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
xhr.send(JSON.stringify({ name: 'Akhil', age: 25 }));
```

* Sends data in the body
* Best for submitting forms, uploading files, etc.

---

## üß† TL;DR for Notes

```md
### `GET` vs `POST`

- **GET**: Retrieves data ‚Äî data goes in URL  
- **POST**: Sends data ‚Äî data goes in body  
- Use `GET` for reading, `POST` for writing/saving
```
